/**
 * BFS : algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures.
 * It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbours.
 *
 * Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful.
 * If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.

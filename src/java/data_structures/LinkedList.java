/**
 * A linear collection of data elements, in which linear order is not given by their physical placement in memory.
 * Instead, each element points to the next. It is a data structure consisting of a group of nodes which together represent a sequence.
 * Under the simplest form, each node is composed of data and a reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence.

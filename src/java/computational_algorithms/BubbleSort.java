/**
 * Simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list to be sorted, compares each pair of adjacent items and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
 * The pass through the list is repeated until no swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted
 *
 * Complexity :
 *
 * - Worst-case performance : O(n^2)
 * - Best-case performance : O(2)
 * - Average performance : O(n^2)
 * - Worst-case space complexity : O(1)

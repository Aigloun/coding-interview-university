/**
 * Search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array.
 *
 * Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array; if they are unequal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated and the search continues on the remaining half until it is successful.
 * If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.
 *
 * Complexity :
 *
 * - Worst-case performance : O(log n)
 * - Best-case performance : O(1)
 * - Average performance : O(log n)
 * - Worst-case space complexity : O(1)

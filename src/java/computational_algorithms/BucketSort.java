 * Sorting algorithm that works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets.
 * Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm.
 *
 * Complexity :
 *
 * - Worst-case performance : O(log n)
 * - Best-case performance : O(n + k)
 * - Average performance : O(n + k)
 * - Worst-case space complexity : O(n * k)
